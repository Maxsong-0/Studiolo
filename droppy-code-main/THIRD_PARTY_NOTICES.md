## T3 Code

Droppy Code began as a native Swift rewrite of T3 Code by T3 Tools Inc. (https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code),
in T3 Code's own repository: the history of this repository carries T3 Code's code, and `LICENSE` keeps
T3 Tools Inc.'s copyright notice beside Droppy Code's.

## Synara

The way Droppy Code keeps a chat responsive under load follows principles studied in Synara
by T3 Tools Inc. and Emanuele Di Pietro (https://github.com/Emanuele-web04/synara), a
TypeScript app whose architecture was read, not copied: nothing synchronous on the click
that opens a chat (its history decodes off the main thread and the selection paints first),
one write to the library for a click rather than one per thread, timeline blocks kept per
thread across switches so coming back to a chat reuses them, the chat column staying put
while only the transcript is swapped, sidebar rows reading their own thread rather than
the whole list, generous parse caches so scrolling back through a long thread never parses
again, and rows built lazily so a popover opens on what is visible. No Synara code is in
this repository; its license is reproduced here in acknowledgement.

## MonoCode

Spending a Codex account's banked rate-limit resets from the usage popover (`DroppyCode/Providers/CodexSession.swift`,
`DroppyCode/Views/Common/UsageViews.swift`) follows MonoCode by hardbeat920, https://github.com/hardbeat920/monocode,
`src/lib/rateLimitsFetch.ts` and `src/chrome/UsageProviderChip.tsx`: the app-server's `account/rateLimitResetCredit/consume`
call sent with an idempotency key, the reset credits read beside the rate limits, the confirm step before a reset is spent,
and the four outcomes it can answer with. No MonoCode code is in this repository; its license is reproduced here in
acknowledgement.
